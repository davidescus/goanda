# goanda

Thanks to: https://github.com/AwolDes/goanda   

A Golang wrapper for the [OANDA v20 API](http://developer.oanda.com/rest-live-v20/introduction/). Currently OANDA has wrappers for Python, Javascript and Java. Goanda exists to extend upon those languages because of the increasing popularity of Go and for a side prject I'm working on.
